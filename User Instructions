User Instructions
Initial Setup

Start the Agents:

One Commander process (give it the Commander prompt above)
One process per Soldier (give each the Soldier prompt above)
Each Soldier should have a unique name/ID
That's it! Soldiers will automatically detect the OS and set up file watching.


Initialize Soldier Profiles:

Edit each Soldier's profile.json to define their specialty
Examples:

Soldier-1: Frontend (React, UI, CSS)
Soldier-2: Backend (Node.js, Express, APIs)
Soldier-3: Database (SQL, migrations, queries)
Soldier-4: Testing (Jest, integration tests, QA)





Note: You do NOT need to manually set up file watching. Each Soldier will automatically:

Detect what operating system it's running on
Choose the most efficient file watching method available
Set up continuous monitoring of its task.json file
Handle all the technical details without your intervention

How to Use
Only interact with the Commander. Never prompt Soldiers directly.

Describe goals, not implementation:

✓ "Add user authentication to the app"
✓ "Fix the bug where the dashboard crashes on load"
✗ "Modify src/App.js line 47 to add a useEffect hook"


Let Commander orchestrate:

Commander will break down your request
Commander will assign tasks to appropriate Soldiers
Commander will handle coordination


Get status updates:

Ask Commander: "What's the status on the authentication feature?"
Commander will aggregate Soldier logs and respond


Change global behavior:

Tell Commander about workflow preferences
Commander will update rules.md
All Soldiers will automatically pick up changes on next task


Trust the system:

Soldiers work autonomously
They maintain detailed logs
Commander aggregates everything for you



Best Practices
For Debugging Issues:

Be clear about symptoms: "Dashboard shows blank page on load"
Provide reproduction steps if you have them
Let Commander assign debugging following the logging protocol

For New Features:

Describe the desired functionality: "Users should be able to reset their password via email"
Trust the prototype-then-integrate approach
Commander will coordinate testing and integration

For Refactoring:

Explain what's wrong with current code: "The API layer is hard to test"
Describe desired improvements: "Make it more modular and testable"
Commander will plan the refactoring strategy

For Questions About Progress:

"What's done so far on feature X?"
"Which Soldier is working on the auth system?"
"Show me what Soldier-2 has been doing"

Workflow Tips

Start with Small Tasks: Test the system with smaller requests first to ensure everything is working properly.
Review Logs Periodically: Ask Commander to summarize recent activity to stay informed.
Provide Feedback: If you notice patterns or issues, tell Commander so they can update rules.
Trust the Process: The debug-heavy and prototype-first approaches might feel slow initially, but they prevent bigger issues and rework.
Leverage Specialization: As Soldiers specialize in different areas, related tasks will get faster due to context reuse.

Monitoring
Check these periodically:

/agents/commander/commander_state.json - overall project status
/agents/soldiers/*/status.json - individual Soldier health
/agents/soldiers/*/log.md - detailed work history

Health Indicators:

All Soldiers showing "idle" or "working" = healthy
Soldiers showing "error" = needs attention
Soldiers stuck in "working" too long = might be blocked

Troubleshooting
If a Soldier isn't responding:

Check if the file watcher is running
Verify task.json is being written correctly
Check Soldier's log.md for errors

If tasks are failing repeatedly:

Ask Commander about the failure pattern
Consider if the task needs different context
Check if rules.md needs clarification

If work is slow:

Verify tasks are properly parallelized
Check if Soldiers have appropriate context loaded
Consider if more Soldiers are needed

Example Interaction Flow
You: "Add a dark mode toggle to the app"
Commander: "I'll break this down into tasks:

Create dark mode theme variables
Implement theme context and provider
Add toggle component to navbar
Update all components to respect theme

Assigning to Soldier-1 (Frontend Specialist) since they have all the frontend context loaded. Estimated time: 30-45 minutes."
[Later]
Commander: "Dark mode feature complete. Soldier-1 built a prototype in /sandbox/dark-mode/, tested it, then integrated into the main app. Files modified:

src/styles/themes.css (new dark theme variables)
src/context/ThemeContext.js (new)
src/components/Navbar.jsx (added toggle)
src/App.js (wrapped with ThemeProvider)

The toggle is in the navbar's top-right corner. Full implementation details in /agents/soldiers/soldier-1/log.md.
Would you like me to add dark mode support to any additional components, or implement theme persistence across sessions?"
Advanced Usage
Scaling Up:

Add more Soldiers as project complexity grows
Specialize Soldiers in specific domains
Use codebase partitioning for very large projects

Complex Workflows:

Commander can chain tasks across Soldiers
Use dependencies in task.json for sequential work
Soldiers can work in parallel on independent features

Integration with Tools:

Soldiers can use any tools available in their environment
Install testing frameworks, linters, bundlers as needed
Configure tools in rules.md for consistency


Summary of Key Improvements
1. Context Management

Explicit instructions on loading full context for debugging
Codebase partitioning strategy for large projects
Context tracking via context_cache.json
Context reuse through specialized Soldiers

2. Debugging Methodology

Comprehensive logging protocol (log everything)
Systematic approach: hypothesis → test → analyze → fix
Error handling requirements: try-catch everywhere, never fail silently
Debug output examples in multiple languages

3. Feature Development

Prototype-first approach for large features
Staged integration with testing checkpoints
Risk reduction through isolation testing
Clear integration planning before merging

4. Communication & Monitoring

status.json for real-time Soldier monitoring
Enhanced question system with priorities
Detailed logging format with timestamps and structure
Commander aggregation for user-friendly reporting

5. Error Recovery

Explicit reassignment protocol when Soldiers fail
Failure documentation requirements
Decision framework for retry vs. reassign
Learning from failures to improve future assignments

6. System Optimization

Parallel execution for independent tasks
Context reuse for related tasks
Log summarization to prevent bloat
Codebase mapping for better routing decisions

This enhanced system should provide a robust, efficient, and scalable multi-agent development environment that follows best practices for debugging, feature development, and context management.
